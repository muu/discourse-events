  As soon as a new client_id is passed for the same API key, the key record
  will be updated to contain the new client_id automatically.
  See Auth::DefaultCurrentUserProvider#lookup_user_api_user_and_update_key

  This means that rate limits could be exceeded in some cases.
  TODO: Instead we should allow a unique key to be created for each client.
